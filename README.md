# YGROUP - Interview Project

### Project - Random Facts Timeline

Build a SPA that follows these requirements: 
 * Place to generate a random year fact. You can use this endpoint from NumbersAPI: http://numbersapi.com/random/year?json
 * Parse the information needed from each fact
 * List the years in a timeline
 * Clicking in each year should show more info with that year's fact information.
 * Ability to remove uninteresting facts.
 
### How is this project organized?
This project uses Create-React-App in its initial state. If the interviewee pretends to start the project in another React environment other than CRA is free to do so.

### Main goals
The main goal of this project is for us to assess your skills, your logic-thinking as well as your level of comfort with different web technologies. 

You can use any library available (i.e. state management libraries). Choice and usage of libraries will also weight in the evaluation.
 
### Design Idea

You can choose to implement the design given or change it to something more of your liking. Attention to detail and usability concerns is appreciated.
